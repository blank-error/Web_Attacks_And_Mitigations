Web_Attacks_And_Mitigations

Project Overview
This project demonstrates five common web application vulnerabilities—Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Brute Force, and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)—using a custom-built vulnerable PHP-based website. Each attack is documented with its exploitation process, followed by secure coding techniques and mitigation strategies including input validation, prepared statements, access controls, and session-based authentication. The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of web security principles, attack methodologies, and defense mechanisms.
